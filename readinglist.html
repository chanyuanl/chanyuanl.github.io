        <h1>Reading List</h1>
        
        <p>I have been hoping to read a little bit more since arriving in college. The temptations to remain illiterate are endless. But now I'm actively trying to find ways to motivate myself to read more, by taking notes on books I read and sharing them with people.</p>
        <p>
        Below you can find a list of books I hope to start reading before the end of 2021.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href='http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGnov1817public.pdf'>The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry</a></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>When introduced to a new idea, always ask
why you should care. Do not expect an answer right away, but demand an answer
eventually. Try at least to apply any new abstraction to some concrete example
you can understand well.</li>
                    <li>
                        This is often
the content of a second course in algebraic geometry, and in an ideal world, people would learn this material over many years, after having background courses
in commutative algebra, algebraic topology, differential geometry, complex analysis, homological algebra, number theory, and French literature. We do not live in
an ideal world. For this reason, the book is written as a first introduction, but a
challenging one.

                        With this book, it is possible to leave without regret after learning about category
theory, or about sheaves, or about geometric spaces, having become a better person.
