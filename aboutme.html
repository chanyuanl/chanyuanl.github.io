        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I use this website as a place to record some random thoughts and take notes from things I learned about. I also try to get creative sometimes and you might find some of the results here.

            Right now, I'm interested in learning the "big picture" of programming/mathematics/physics, what do they really mean and what I can do with them. I'm also attempting my very first game jam. As a freshmen in college I plan to major in Computer Science and Math/Physics.

            I have been really into rock climbing since I started college, but still need to buy my first pair of climbing shoes. I have hiked and cycled a few times and I enjoyed those experiences, might do more in the future.
